# Ozip Decrypting online made easy #

## What this is? ##
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an easy way to decrypt Ozip ( Firmware of oppo/realme) to a TWRP Flashable Zip!!

This works with GitHub actions, thank GitHub not me : )

### How to use ###

Here are some useful notes to using this tool brewed with black magic xD !

1. Fork the repo.

2. Set the variables, as listed below.

##Some variables that you'd like to set:##

```FIRMWARE_LIK : Direct Link to ozip (can be found in realme/oppo website), update in .github/workflows/auto-ozip-decrypt.yml```

```FIRMWARE_NAME : The Name of Ozip (like CPH1861EX_11_OTA_0500_all_fLuS0Ipoe93t.ozip), update in .github/workflows/auto-ozip-decrypt.yml```

3. Go to actions tab, enable workflows.

4. Star the repo, go to actions tab again, and let Magic Work xD

## To Note ##
The zip will be uploaded to bashupload. But it will be there for only 15 days. So it's preferable to mirror somewhere else.

You can use some telegram bots to rename & mirror to gdrive. You can use my bot too.
